This first big event of the year which gives restaurants and hotels a chance to deck up after the Christmas decorations are packed away is plump with possibilities to showcase a restaurant in many ways.

It’s a given that for most couples, and now increasingly friends, colleagues and families, choose to celebrate love with a lunch or dinner at a restaurant on Valentine’s Day. So how do you make sure your restaurant is the most sought after V-day venue?

Like everything, this calls for some advance planning too. But before that, it’s important to evaluate the kind of restaurant you are - a fine dining restaurant, a lounge bar, a dessert, and ice-cream bar, a five-star hotel’s restaurant…

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_1670605041-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3258" src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_1670605041-1-400x373.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="373" align="left" style="margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 60px /></a>

Varun Pereira of Sly Granny says `destination restaurants’ which offer ambiance, a certain premium fare, and are known for being classy are usually the ones that become the pick of couples celebrating Valentine’s Day. ``Most people would like to impress their dates and thus make these destination restaurants their first choice. ‘’ They could be stand-alone or in a five-star hotel. A special occasion demands a special place to dine.

Knowing what category you fall into will help you plan an appropriate Valentine’s day offering for your customers. If you are a burger joint, you will definitely not be offering limousine services to pick up and drop off your guests. Nor will you go to great lengths to stock up your bar with an expensive inventory. So knowing your category and who your clients are will help you tailor your offerings for maximum impact.

Plan ahead:Any promotion needs to be planned well in advance. Xerxes Bodhanwala of The Red Fork in Bangalore recalls when he was doing specially curated menus and sit down dinners for Valentine’s Day a few years ago, he would start planning as early as January. ``Once your plan is in place, you can start spreading the word, around the end of January or the beginning of February, going aggressive with the publicity, closer to the date. ‘’
Mode of publicity: Various restaurateurs swear by different modes of publicity. If you have a budget and conventional advertising has worked for you in the past or you’re trying it for the first time, ensure you get a good place/position in the newspaper. Around this time, many newspapers offer attractive discounts for Valentine’s day promotions to advertisers. So you have to ensure that your restaurant’s ad does not get lost in the clutter of V-day ads.

Also, it pays not to put all your eggs in one basket or invest your entire advertising budget on just one kind of publicity. Most restaurateurs now use social media to publicise events at their restaurant. You can choose to employ a variety of publicity options – conventional advertising – newspaper, billboards, pamphlets radio or local cable channels, word of mouth publicity, social media and even tent cards and posters inside your restaurant announcing the upcoming Valentine’s Day specials. Don’t forget to send out mailers to your regular customers.
<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_567010213-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3260" src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_567010213-1-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" align="right" align="left" style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 60px/></a>
Create a special experience: Yes, we all know that people come to a restaurant to eat but surely on a special day, you can give them something to talk about? If your restaurant has a youthful vibe and is a young people’s hangout, you could create something that will connect with your audience – perhaps a photo booth with a backdrop or Instant photos with couples carrying typographic cards saying ``Awesome Twosome’’ or something funny.

Ambience: Again, depending on the kind of restaurant, you could go from red and white colour schemes to a more classy décor of candles and roses, special table linen, a playlist of romantic songs, and other decorations to deck up your restaurant. Don’t forget to do up the façade of the restaurant too. Some restaurants get their waitstaff to add a V-day accessory to their uniforms – either heart badges or even an entirely different uniform.

Special menu: Coming to the food, which is the main appeal of your restaurant, it should naturally match up to the mood of the occasion. Says Bodhanwala, ``In the past, we have tried a specially curated meal, sit down dinners with candles and the works. Since most people come to our restaurant for food, that is our main focus.’’

Beverages: A specially crafted beverages menu will also be an excellent way to not only create exciting drinks with romantic names, but it will also help you increase the bill value per table.
Collaborations: Valentine’s Day will draw people in if you have collaborations with partners, who can add value to your offerings. If food is your specialty, you can collaborate with a beverage partner to offer it with a meal at a discount. Champagne and wines are in huge demand for a celebratory meal. With special collaborations, you can give your guests a special offering.

Another important thing to remember is not to add interactive events to your evening’s offerings. Most couples would like to be left alone for some me-time. Allow for it and facilitate their celebration with impeccable service and fine food.

With all these plans in action at your restaurant, get ready to welcome a wave of customers celebrating their love on Valentine’s Day!]]></description>

Is this something you need to consider, and if so, what does it take to make your food service business offer hyper-local cuisine? What is the culinary experience you can create for your customers from hyper-local food, and how interested do you think your customers will be on menus based on this trend?

What is hyper-local food? As we know, local food is that which is sourced near the place where it is consumed. Local, however, does not necessarily mean in the immediate environs of the consumer. There are definitions such as the one from the United States Department of Agriculture that a local product is one that comes from no more than 500 miles away, while other definitions suggest food from100-150 miles away. Either way, this is not exactly ‘next door’ and can take several days to reach the destination, impacting the freshness of the food and possibly requiring artificial means to preserve it. 

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_631559033.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_631559033-400x287.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="287" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3241" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 60px/></a>

Hyper-local, on the other hand, is exactly what the name implies--extremely local--to the extent that the produce is cultivated or grown on the premises of the restaurant offering hyper-local cuisine.
An extension of this concept, ‘locally-sourced’, is food sourced from a place close to the restaurant or grown exclusively for it in an environment which the restaurant can control or verify.

Globally, ‘Buy Fresh, Buy Local’ is becoming a common sign around stores that sell locally sourced produce and perishables. Food trends over recent years have veered towards food labelled according to its source and method of cultivation – organic food, locally sourced food, farm to table, farm to fork, organic, and so on as customers become more and more conscious of the nutritional value of food as well as the perceived impact of transporting food over long distances, both on the environment and on the quality of the food itself. 

The interest in sustainable development, i.e., food produced with an equal importance to responsibility towards the environment as well as economic growth and viability, further created a demand for locally sourced and hyper-local food. Customers are looking for food – produce, meat and poultry, seafood and other perishables that are fresh and grown in sustainable conditions, and this in turn, has impacted the restaurants patronised by such customers.

Some restaurants around the world have started growing at least a part of their ingredients on their own premises, depending on space and infrastructure available to them. Kitchen gardens, backyards, window sills, rooftop and terrace gardens are now used for growing herbs and plants which do not need too much space and are low-maintenance. 


Hydroponics is another trend that is spreading: soil-less gardening, where healthy plants are grown without using soil or dirt as a medium and instead cultivated with the help of sunlight and nutrients such as a mineral-rich water solution. These plants are grown in any available space including walls or suspended from the ceiling, with the roots hanging in the enriched water or set into gravel.

Space, efforts and time for gardening are a constraint in a restaurant invested in hyper-local cuisine. It is also a fact that not all the ingredients required by a kitchen can be readily grown on the premises, and the next best solution has been locally sourced food.
<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_578023441-3.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_578023441-3-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3245"align="right" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 60px /></a>
Small farms are coming up in and near urban areas, to cater to this requirement. The produce and meat take less time to reach the restaurant and hence are fresher, tastier and cultivated to manage the demand. Produce can be harvested and delivered the same day or the next day at the latest, similarly, butchery items may be supplied fresh, depending on the delivery schedule.

Restaurants with more resources at their disposal have their own ‘home-farm’ which supplies most of the ingredients required, and though not on the same premises, is under the control of the restaurateur.

Why go hyper-local? What are the benefits?
Many restaurateurs are beginning to feel a responsibility to have an in-depth understanding of the food that is served to the customer – the source, the conditions under which it is grown or developed, whether pesticides are used, the freshness and other such matters. Chefs around the world are consciously promoting locally procured food on their menus.

1.	Due to hyper-local sourcing of food, there is vertical integration and the restaurant is more in control of the entire chain, right from raw materials and production to the condition in which the food is transported to the end user.

2.	The middleman is kept out, in most cases, and the proceeds go to the development of the local community and its economy. Hyperlocal and locally sourced food contribute to a sustainable agricultural economy.

3.	The food supply is seasonal and hence offers the Chef more variety in taste and flavor, to offer to the customer. Produce is more likely to be harvested at peak quality.

4.	Locally grown food reaches the customer sooner than that procured from elsewhere, and is by and large, more fresh and nutritious than ingredients which come from further away. It thereby promotes good health, which is why customers are looking at the source of food supply to the restaurant. 

5.	Purchase options from local growers on small landholdings are more likely to include heirloom and non-GMO varieties than when purchased from bulk and corporate suppliers, though of course there are now corporate farms making a name for themselves by the quality and origin of the produce. Heirloom and native varieties are usually tastier and more nutritious apart from being fresh as they have traveled shorter distances. 


The best reason of all? It’s what many customers are looking for, and the concept is marketing itself with its popularity, especially among health conscious customers.

There is a downside though!
A restaurant cannot usually run on local supplies alone for its perishables, through the year. Locally sourced or hyper-local ingredients generally tend to be more expensive than bulk purchases. Purchase quantities may be lesser and hence discounts availed from bulk purchase may not be possible. Some items which are required regularly may not be available due to seasonality and need to be procured elsewhere.Local suppliers may not consistently generate the volumes required by the restaurant. The menu may require more variety than is available from the produce of the locale.The menu will fluctuate based on the seasonality of ingredients and needs to be structured accordingly and take into account possible delivery or quality failures.

A judicious mix of hyper-local, local sourcing and purchase from various other supply points may be needed to cater to all the requirements of the restaurant.

<strong>Authentic tastes and culinary experiences inspired by local cuisine:</strong>

Building a menu around local and cultural cuisine can be an interesting experience.

Combining culinary tourism with an authentic food experience, there are restaurants which offer a day’s fishing, after which the customer gets to taste his own catch served up to him for dinner.

Some restaurants in the USA and the UK have gone completely hyper-local, with food served to customers only from their own home-grown produce, seafood, meat, and poultry, or with a combination of their own and very local sourcing.
 
One restaurant advertises its ‘Two Hour Salad’ made from ingredients which reach the customer’s plate within 2 hours from being harvested from the restaurant’s own farm, that raises vegetables, fruits and herbs. Items such as cheese, fish, meat, poultry and wine are locally sourced. 

Another has done away with the fixed menu and instead offers the customer a unique dining experience with dishes from ingredients harvested each day from the farm or farmers markets.

Yet another restaurant started as a trailer with a wood-burning grill. As it grew and acquired fame, meat, grains, cheese, fresh produce, honey and even olive oil as well as flowers for decorating the restaurant were sourced from about 50 local producers, making it a great community effort.

It is not just fresh produce and eggs which are sourced locally. Restaurants are procuring seafood from sustainable fisheries, meat from pastured meat producers, as well as bread from local bakeries who source the wheat again from the locality. 
Beehives are set up on rooftop gardens for producing honey for use in the restaurant in soups, salad dressings, pastries, ice cream, desserts and even in cocktails. Jams made by members of the local community find their way into desserts. Table and kitchen scraps are used for composting for the plants grown in the home farm.
 
One enterprising restaurateur in the USA offers a menu of items such as pork chops, steaks, country fried quail and glazed chicken breasts, all from livestock from their farm on a piece of land adjoining the restaurant. Fresh produce is grown on the land while some of it is used for grazing for the farms cows.

Another restaurant managed farm has its chefs and farmers planning together for specific crops for scheduled periods of the year, such as brussel sprouts grown in time for Thanksgiving, root vegetables to cater to the offseason when green vegetables are scarce and onions for onion soup on the menu in winter. The farm even grows some specialised grains for adding variety to the menu.

With the growing interest in local sourcing, many chefs are creating menus on cuisines defined by the ingredients locally available and this encourages ethnic and cultural cuisines to find their way back to the table. 
Some chefs use the local ingredients for dishes inspired from global cuisine. So you have the Rhubarb Lassi and Smoked Bourbon with rose, pomegranate, star anise, and orange infused ice cubes. Or Baked Potato skin stuffed with curried rice.

As customer tastes and culinary expectations move towards food grown locally in sustainable environments, the restaurant menu looks more and more interesting with options for more variety and mix of flavours.

Is this something you need to consider, and if so, what does it take to make your food service business offer hyper-local cuisine? What is the culinary experience you can create for your customers from hyper-local food, and how interested do you think your customers will be on menus based on this trend?

What is hyper-local food? As we know, local food is that which is sourced near the place where it is consumed. Local, however, does not necessarily mean in the immediate environs of the consumer. There are definitions such as the one from the United States Department of Agriculture that a local product is one that comes from no more than 500 miles away, while other definitions suggest food from100-150 miles away. Either way, this is not exactly ‘next door’ and can take several days to reach the destination, impacting the freshness of the food and possibly requiring artificial means to preserve it. 

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_631559033.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_631559033-400x287.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="287" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3241" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 60px/></a>

Hyper-local, on the other hand, is exactly what the name implies--extremely local--to the extent that the produce is cultivated or grown on the premises of the restaurant offering hyper-local cuisine.
An extension of this concept, ‘locally-sourced’, is food sourced from a place close to the restaurant or grown exclusively for it in an environment which the restaurant can control or verify.

Globally, ‘Buy Fresh, Buy Local’ is becoming a common sign around stores that sell locally sourced produce and perishables. Food trends over recent years have veered towards food labelled according to its source and method of cultivation – organic food, locally sourced food, farm to table, farm to fork, organic, and so on as customers become more and more conscious of the nutritional value of food as well as the perceived impact of transporting food over long distances, both on the environment and on the quality of the food itself. 

The interest in sustainable development, i.e., food produced with an equal importance to responsibility towards the environment as well as economic growth and viability, further created a demand for locally sourced and hyper-local food. Customers are looking for food – produce, meat and poultry, seafood and other perishables that are fresh and grown in sustainable conditions, and this in turn, has impacted the restaurants patronised by such customers.

Some restaurants around the world have started growing at least a part of their ingredients on their own premises, depending on space and infrastructure available to them. Kitchen gardens, backyards, window sills, rooftop and terrace gardens are now used for growing herbs and plants which do not need too much space and are low-maintenance. 


Hydroponics is another trend that is spreading: soil-less gardening, where healthy plants are grown without using soil or dirt as a medium and instead cultivated with the help of sunlight and nutrients such as a mineral-rich water solution. These plants are grown in any available space including walls or suspended from the ceiling, with the roots hanging in the enriched water or set into gravel.

Space, efforts and time for gardening are a constraint in a restaurant invested in hyper-local cuisine. It is also a fact that not all the ingredients required by a kitchen can be readily grown on the premises, and the next best solution has been locally sourced food.
<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_578023441-3.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_578023441-3-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3245"align="right" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 60px /></a>
Small farms are coming up in and near urban areas, to cater to this requirement. The produce and meat take less time to reach the restaurant and hence are fresher, tastier and cultivated to manage the demand. Produce can be harvested and delivered the same day or the next day at the latest, similarly, butchery items may be supplied fresh, depending on the delivery schedule.

Restaurants with more resources at their disposal have their own ‘home-farm’ which supplies most of the ingredients required, and though not on the same premises, is under the control of the restaurateur.

Why go hyper-local? What are the benefits?
Many restaurateurs are beginning to feel a responsibility to have an in-depth understanding of the food that is served to the customer – the source, the conditions under which it is grown or developed, whether pesticides are used, the freshness and other such matters. Chefs around the world are consciously promoting locally procured food on their menus.

1.	Due to hyper-local sourcing of food, there is vertical integration and the restaurant is more in control of the entire chain, right from raw materials and production to the condition in which the food is transported to the end user.

2.	The middleman is kept out, in most cases, and the proceeds go to the development of the local community and its economy. Hyperlocal and locally sourced food contribute to a sustainable agricultural economy.

3.	The food supply is seasonal and hence offers the Chef more variety in taste and flavor, to offer to the customer. Produce is more likely to be harvested at peak quality.

4.	Locally grown food reaches the customer sooner than that procured from elsewhere, and is by and large, more fresh and nutritious than ingredients which come from further away. It thereby promotes good health, which is why customers are looking at the source of food supply to the restaurant. 

5.	Purchase options from local growers on small landholdings are more likely to include heirloom and non-GMO varieties than when purchased from bulk and corporate suppliers, though of course there are now corporate farms making a name for themselves by the quality and origin of the produce. Heirloom and native varieties are usually tastier and more nutritious apart from being fresh as they have traveled shorter distances.

Why should the food menu reflect all the excitement, always? The beverage menu is also an integral part of the food offering at a restaurant. Very rarely do people order just food and leave out beverages. If nothing, at least a fresh lime soda or a cola is ordered along with a meal, or sometimes even a hot beverage to wash down a quick meal.

Cultural contexts and propriety demand that restaurants offer a glass of water to customers in India. While most waiters have been trained to ask if their customers will have regular or bottled water (sometimes there’s a choice of sparkling too), some restaurants have tried to add value to the regular water served to their customers. Whether it’s glass bottles or glass jars kept at the table, you might find water flavoured with fresh sprigs of mint or wedges of lemon or orange. These small touches look pretty and give the customer an added value to the most basic of requirements on the menu.

A well-designed beverage menu can make bottom line healthy for a restaurant. But really how much of Gin and Tonic can you drink? There may be days when you want to give that neat whiskey a rest and opt for something that’s not a beer or a sugary mocktail? While a certain sameness in the menu can be comforting, it can also set in a sense of déjà vu. Bartenders are also looking for a challenge to stir things up at their end, and experimenting with different themes can bring some excitement on both sides of the bar.
So why are themes important? Firstly, it helps the restaurant stay on top of trends. Seasons are the easiest to use as an inspiration while crafting a menu. If it’s summer, your customers are likely to look for something that’s light, refreshing and cool to wash down with their food. Customers will likely order more drinks than food because the heat can dull hunger. Lighter, less potent spirits may be preferred and customers may be looking for something new other than the Long Island Ice Tea or Pina Colada. Adding a prefix “Summer menu’’ could help you make this new set of drinks relevant to the season. The same holds with winter, or the Monsoon season which is specific to India. Winters see a lot of warm, spicy drinks being preferred to the cooling drinks of summer. 

Big events like the IPL series, Olympics, the Super Bowl, the Football World cup or an F1 race offer themselves as themes to create special beverage menus. A lot of customers love to watch sports on the big screen at their favourite watering hole, with their friends. This is a good opportunity for restaurants and bars to capitalize on the mood of the moment and craft a different menu for sports lovers, create a special ambience with a sports theme and have offers and contests to draw more people. While most have big screens and contests and special offers, menus take inspiration from teams playing on a particular day. During IPL, one restaurant was offering dishes and drinks around the theme of the teams playing on that day. Drinks were interestingly named after some of the star cricketers and cricket terminology like ``Maiden over’ and ``Leg Before Wicket’’ and the food was inspired by the cuisine found in the states that the team came from. If it was a home team game, then there was no guesses as to who was the muse for the menu. In Bengaluru, one pub named it’s beverage special for the week as ``Namma Match Menu’’ to create around a big match involved the home team. Drinks were named after the typical language usage in the city like `Swalpa adjust maadi’ and`Sakkath Hot drink.’

Special themes help to create a stir and get people buzzing about your new menu and the innovatively named drinks. 
Leverage a big event: Themes also help you market your product on social media. Restaurants create social media campaigns centered around their themes to generate excitement and increase footfalls into their restaurant. When you have a theme that is reflecting something topical – like summer/winter, a cricket match, a sports event or a major event that everyone is talking about, you can ride on the coattails of an already trending topic and win some brownie points.

<b><i>Manage costs</b></i>
A smart chef/bartender is one who keeps costs low while investing heavily on imagination. Using seasonal vegetables and fruits as the inspiration, a restaurant can make use of seasonal produce in their beverage menus and take advantage of the competitive pricing. Using seasonal vegetables is good to keep costs low while also giving chefs and bartenders an opportunity to work with fresh and local ingredients. Seasonal fruits and vegetables also help you plan menus in advance, knowing that a particular fruit will be in season at a particular time. 

Theme menus are great as a marketing gimmick. When everyone is counting down to a new season of Game of Thrones, a good chef/bartender could come up with cocktails that are built around the theme of the TV series that has taken the world by storm. You can’t go wrong with this kind of a promotion, provided you invest some thought into the characters and how to adapt their characteristics to your drinks.

Themes are also great to target a specific group of customers who might be feeling left out with a generic menu. If you’re having a Daiquiri promotion or a Bloody Mary promotion, a Blood Mary fan is definitely going to check out your menu. So theme menus help in reaching out to previously ignored groups of customers and grow your customer base.
Themes in menus can shake up a restaurant kitchen staff in a good way. It can create excitement, increase focus on work, add to research and help them expand their skills too. And not to forget, bring in more customers too. What’s your winning theme for the season?

Restaurants and pubs have taken a special effort to make this a huge success, and it seems to have worked very well for them. 

Posters and announcements have already gone up on social media platforms and event listing sites have a dedicated page for Halloween parties. With every year there seem to be more and more restaurants doing something interesting for Halloween and why not? It’s a day that is plump with opportunities.

Halloween celebrations in restaurants and pubs seem to have many takers.  It’s a fun event for adults to dress up and party. Because why should adults be left behind on Halloween? Who wouldn’t love to play dress up and have some fun?

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_477330562.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_477330562-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3157" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 60px /></a>

Restaurants that would normally entice their customers with fun and inviting décor are quite happy to explore a scare fest to draw their customers in for this day, the 31st of October. Traditionally, Halloween is celebrated in neighbourhoods or in party halls where parents and children gather for tricks, treats and costume parties.

Restaurants have seen the business opportunity in opening their doors to costume-clad Halloween enthusiasts who are quite happy to celebrate this day with food, cocktails and more. Besides, Halloween is no time to be sitting at home and watching a horror movie with a tub of popcorn. There are far better things to do, like go on a Halloween hopping trail of all the restaurants and pubs which have a special promotion on for the festival.

With Diwali and Dussehra done, Halloween fills in a gap by giving restaurants, pubs and customers, something fun to do. It’s a long wait till Thanksgiving and even longer till the countdown to Christmas. So dressing up like zombies and ghosts is a great way to show your creativity with makeup.

Also, since not everyone gets invited or hosts a Halloween party at home, partying at a restaurant is the next best option. And you can choose how you wish to celebrate this day. Different restaurants and pubs have focused on different ways to ring in Halloween this year. Each outlet finds innovative ways to lure customers in with their ‘Halloween-special’ food, décor or activities. 

At Hilton Embassy Golf Links, there’s a Harry Potter-theme party complete with Elixir of Life cocktails, free handouts of glow bands and candies, and a feast like at Hogwarts. Clearly aimed at Potterheads, anyone looking for something fun to do on Halloween night, will consider this seriously.

Restaurants can borrow heavily from all the scary theme movies and pop culture references for everything from décor, food, drink and activities. A joke that was going around on social media said, `I’m not going to do any dusting this week because it’s Halloween. ’ So yes, if you’d like to dine in a restaurant with fake cobwebs, drop down paper bats suspended from the ceiling, dim lights, carved out pumpkins and haunting music, you have plenty of options.

Just to prove that all you need is imagination to connect anything with Halloween, Phoenix Market city had a Hallo-wine festival, a wine festival showcasing premium wines, a flea market, grape stomping music and stand-up comedy. 
Not missing out on the Halloween excitement are big brand hotels like Ritz Carlton which had pre-Halloween events at the Bang, the terrace bar. Guests were offered complimentary blood shots, encouraged to dress up in ghoulish costumes and a face painting artist at the venue put the final touches to their spooktacular looks.

What’s a Halloween without some spooky activities?  If you find pumpkin carving too sedate, Prost has a zombie-theme evening with customers being encouraged to dress like zombies, act like zombies and engage in a Human vs Zombie battle. The allure is, of course, the promise of prizes to be won and free beer.


Clubs have found a way to add an Indian touch to Halloween, by have DJs spinning people’s favourite Bollywood tracks. Even Zombies must dance!

Making the most of the horror films and spooky movies is Social, which is screening movies like The Conjuring and the Addams Family while putting out special food and drinks for the occasion. All you have to do is dress up and show up.

But the most fascinating aspect of Halloween is the variety of food and drinks that can be created for this special occasion. Even if you don’t have a special menu, you could give the dishes spooky names. From Witches Brew to Poison Punch, there’s no limit to the names you can conjure up. If they look especially disgusting with floating eyes (chia seeds or sabja seeds can do the trick or an olive made to look like an eye), it can make the drink all the more appropriate for the occasion. 

To add theatrics to a drink, a lot of bars are using smoke guns, dry ice or smoking a garnish. Unusual food colours can give regular drinks a creepy cred and how. The world has gone quite crazy over the Freakaccino or the Freakshake and if it freak’s you out, it’s probably what should be on every restaurant’s menu. A Freakaccino as created by Bobby Bournias of the Brownstone Pancake Factory is not just a hazelnut cappuccino. The cup’s rim is coated with a generous slather of Nutella and then rolled in crumbled wafers. Then a chocolate cupcake is pierced into the rim of the cup and hazelnut cappuccino is poured into it. Clouds of whipped cream are topped over the coffee and more Nutella drizzled over it. Finally, it’s ready to be consumed with a sprinkle of castor sugar. See, it’s not for the faint-hearted.


Foods with spider web decorations, Oreo cookie bats, gummy worm garnishes and ghost cupcakes are some of the snacks you might find in restaurants. And if it’s served by a zombie, it’s a complete value addition.

And bar counters. This summer instead of strawberry martinis with Elderflower cordial, and Long Island Iced Tea, we saw a lot of desi cocktails and mocktails appearing on bar menus. Not just the ingredients, there was an attempt to serve them in Indian-style brass and copper tumblers.</p>
Bartenders and chefs have always tried to bring in local ingredients into their menus. While the food was the focus of most experimentation, drinks are getting some attention too. Especially the non-conventional ones with local flavours adding to the surprise element.

Fresh coriander leaves, green chillies, tamarind, pepper, red chillies – there’s no stopping bartenders from borrowing freely from the masala counter.

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_603526148.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2961" src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_603526148-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" align="right" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 25px//></a>

Muddling drinks with lemon and basil leaves is old hat. Of course, the classic mojito will always be a favourite but bartenders are flavouring drinks with new herbs. Curry leaves and tulsi are being tossed into drinks to add new flavours. The bold flavours of fresh curry leaves, crushed and tossed in a drink are magical, with the spicy notes diffusing around you as you savour the drink. Another Indian favourite that has made its way into drinks is paan or betel leaf. The paan (betel leaf pockets filled with arecanut, coconut shavings, sweet syrup and fennel) has long been an after-dinner mouth freshner.But it’s now making inroads into the bar menu with paan-flavoured drinks. Chopped and added as a garnish or muddled with lemon wedges, the fresh notes of betel leaf are indeed very refreshing. You can start with a paan-flavoured drink and round off the evening with a maghai. From paan shots to paan punch, the astringent quality of the betel leaf is an acquired taste though.

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_305748524.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2957 size-medium" src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_305748524-400x600.jpg" width="400" height="600" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 25px//></a>

Indian flavours, fruit, herbs and ingredients seem to be finding favour in Indian kitchen with bartenders concocting cocktails with a desi twist. We were surprised to come across the Shikanjiroshka, at one of the bars. Shikanji is a summer staple in North Indian homes. With summers extending over three months and temperatures soaring really high, guests are offered tall glasses of shikanji when visiting homes in North India. The Shikanji is good old lemon juice laced with cumin powder, black salt, pepper and ginger. The Sikanjiroshka that we tried was laced with vodka and crushed mint leaves to add more punch to a summer favourite. We also came across, at the same bar, the Liquid Kachumbar cocktail, a drink that had white rum, coriander, green chillies, Gondhoraj lime from Bengal and cucumber cubes. Kachumbar is a cooling green salad made with cucumbers, coriander and green chillies but here it became the inspiration for a drink.

The juicy Indian guava has also been used quite extensively in drinks with the guava chilli combination seen quite frequently on bar menus. Another fiery drink that caught our attention was the Liquid Guntur Chutney, an ode to the spicy variety of chilli from Andhra Pradesh, mixed with mango juice, vodka and a dash of vanilla.  The drink had the strong flavour of chilli but the sweet mango blunted its edges a bit.

Just like the West is going through a kale and chia seed fixation, we’re rediscovering the wide array of fruits that we’ve been sidelining in favour of oranges and water melons. The purple jamun, with its beautiful pink juice is not only visually appealing but is packed with many health benefits. This summer we sampled a Jamun martini with the sharp flavour of lime. Jamun juice (kala khatta) if you recall, was a summer staple from childhood. The dark purplish black juice, in its concentrate form, was always dramatic in how it coloured the water or ice with its inky hues. Here again, it was spiced with cumin and black salt. The best part of a jamun drink is the slightly astringent after-taste that lingers on your tongue, long after you 've had the drink.

If its summer, the king of fruits – the mango, finds it’s way into most dishes and drinks. Presenting a new way to enjoy a drink, one bar froze mango juice and vodka into an ice gola, a nod to the icy street food dessert that’s common in North India.

Khus, another typical Indian flavour, was a strong favourite this summer for its cooling properties. Paired with chilli, vodka and lemon fizz, this drink was sharp to taste but had a delightfully mild bouquet of aromas.

We also found a jackfruit, vodka and guava drink on a menu. A brave attempt to mix unusual flavours.

A lot of bartenders are experimenting with familiar flavours. A mango drink spiced with a hint of pickle masala or jaggery syrup used to sweeten a cocktail is often seen on bar menus. Another typical Indian favourite is the kokum, that tarty berry which gives you the most beautiful ruby pink juice. Added to any cocktail, it can instantly make it a beautiful drink, while adding the unique sour notes to that drink that Indians along the western coast have enjoyed for ages.

So take a look at what’s in your fridge and think of how you can make you drink a little more desi.]]></description>

The purple jamun, with its beautiful pink juice is not only visually appealing but is packed with many health benefits. This summer we sampled a Jamun martini with the sharp flavour of lime. Jamun juice (kala khatta) if you recall, was a summer staple from childhood. The dark purplish black juice, in its concentrate form, was always dramatic in how it coloured the water or ice with its inky hues. Here again, it was spiced with cumin and black salt. The best part of a jamun drink is the slightly astringent after-taste that lingers on your tongue, long after you 've had the drink.

If its summer, the king of fruits – the mango, finds it’s way into most dishes and drinks. Presenting a new way to enjoy a drink, one bar froze mango juice and vodka into an ice gola, a nod to the icy street food dessert that’s common in North India.

Khus, another typical Indian flavour, was a strong favourite this summer for its cooling properties. Paired with chilli, vodka and lemon fizz, this drink was sharp to taste but had a delightfully mild bouquet of aromas.

We also found a jackfruit, vodka and guava drink on a menu. A brave attempt to mix unusual flavours.

A lot of bartenders are experimenting with familiar flavours. A mango drink spiced with a hint of pickle masala or jaggery syrup used to sweeten a cocktail is often seen on bar menus. Another typical Indian favourite is the kokum, that tarty berry which gives you the most beautiful ruby pink juice. Added to any cocktail, it can instantly make it a beautiful drink, while adding the unique sour notes to that drink that Indians along the western coast have enjoyed for ages.

So take a look at what’s in your fridge and think of how you can make you drink a little more desi.]]></content:encoded>

Today, we’ll go straight to the second and most fun aspect of rains –foods that complement petrichor and warm our hearts and souls.
Unlike the British who are quite happy to offer tea and sympathy as a cure to all ills, Indians love to go beyond just tea. Tea or coffee or a hot beverage can take the sting out of being caught in a sudden downpour but something crunchy to bite into is most welcome. Indian homes have for years had a separate monsoon menu, the prep for which starts well in advance. The tradition of making fritters in summer to stock up for months when vegetables are not always plentiful is now the stuff of sepia-tinted memories, in which our grandmothers dried fritters and papads on the terrace, on old cotton saris.


<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_576068755.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_576068755-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2861 class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2636" align="left"style="margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 25px/></ /></a>

Pakodas probably rate as the hot favorites as rainy season snacks and restaurants offer their take on these fried traditional favorites with many improvisations. From dishing out palak pakodas sprinkled with chaat masala (spinach leaves dipped in spiced chickpea flour and deep fried) to onion bajjis, (as they’re called down South) slivers of onions mixed with cumin, asafoetida and chickpea flour and deep fried, to beer batter prawns, wontons, falafel, Tempura battered onion rings or squid, stuffed chilli pakodas or capsicum fritters, there are crunchy treats from every cuisine. These snacky foods offer instant gratification, whether they are chicken wings or steaming hot boas filled with spicy centers of meat and vegetables.


A well-balanced starter menu will have finger foods from each of the non-veg groups, one each from poultry, pork, beef, fish, seafood and at least 5 varieties of vegetarian starters, favorites among this being paneer and onions. Piping hot and straight off the stove, these crunchy treats, with your beverage of choice, won’t let the monsoons be the damper that they threaten to be. Chefs also make use of the fast petering out mango season. Since the best of the mango crop is behind us, chefs at restaurants start trying out dips and relishes with the last crop of mango, to go with the starters. Mango salsa, mango chunda or mango chutneys are favorites as relishes for their sweet and tangy flavors. Adding innovative flavors, Chefs are spicing up mango relishes with star anise or basil leaves and letting the starters sparkle on your palate with sweet-spicy-tangy dips.

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_512292460-e1499775472605.jpg"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_512292460-e1499775472605-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2868" align="right"style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 30px/></a>

An analysis of items sold during the monsoon season indicates a sudden upsurge in sales of hot beverages like coffee and tea. A lot of restaurants offer these comforting beverages from our childhood too, Horlicks or Bourn vita or even hot chocolate, as a seasonal menu addition. Coffee shops know that they’re often sought out as resting places when a sudden downpour catches commuters by surprise. Hence a lot of coffee shop menus are planned to offer a wider selection of beverages. Apple cider is becoming a hot favorite during the monsoons and stays through the winter season on some café menus. Other monsoon favorites in the beverage category are spiced lattes and caramel lattes with a fat swirl of fresh cream, dark chocolate drinks, masala teas and even Kashmiri kawa. 

Whatever the cuisine, restaurants make sure hearty, filling, and soupy dishes appear on their monsoon menus. Think about it. When it’s wet, grey and cold, there’s nothing more your heart desires than a warm broth that courses through your veins, and warms your soul. Thick and clear soups, broths, soupy dishes like ramen, laksa, mildly flavored stews and flavourful steaming curries with an assortment of meats and vegetables are hot favorites during the monsoons. 


Oriental cuisine lends itself well to hot, soupy dishes. Steaming dim sums, those flavourful parcels stuffed with meat or vegetables, dipped in spicy tangy relishes and paired with soups are an all-time favorite for the monsoon. Many restaurants offering Chinese and Indo-Chinese and Oriental cuisine have dim sums on their menu now. Light, clear soups like lemon and ginger or pokchoy and glass noodles in a clear broth become seasonal stars during the monsoon season. Dishes like Pho; the one-pot Vietnamese meal with slivers of beef, rice, a flavourful broth and noodles is a filling dish that will keep you warm and happy for long. Oriental restaurants also pull out their specialty teas during the rainy season. Jasmine tea, premium green teas and imported Chinese teas are made for the monsoons. Served in dainty cups, these teas can be had alone or as an accompaniment to food.


Monsoon menus are chiefly about comfort foods. There’s something about a cold, wet and rainy evening that creates a vacuum in the pit of your stomach that can only be filled by the comforting bowl of carbohydrates. So a large variety of pastas generously drenched in sauces with vegetables and meat are high of the list of monsoon foods. Then comes the risottos – creamy Arborio rice dishes flavored with ham and mushrooms or cheese and mushrooms. This is baby food for adults – mildly flavored, cheesy, slow-cooked and infused with flavors. Risottos are again one-pot wonders that can be washed down with a glass or two of Riesling or Chardonnay. 



When it comes to Indian food, there’s not much that can stay off the monsoon menu. Again, the biryanis with either meat or vegetables do well in providing the much-needed crab comfort. Kebabs and grilled vegetables are equally preferred to the crunchy fried pakodas. The sizzling warmth of a grill as the rain beats down is strangely comforting. Many restaurants have the concept of live grills at your table. This not only becomes a part of your dining entertainment but also provides a comforting warmth from the wet and cold outside.
Food, you will agree, has a cure for almost everything – from broken hearts to mercurial weather. And if it can add magic to the monsoons too, then why not.]]></description>

<b><i>Now you see me, now you don’t.</b></i>

Popularised in the 2000s in Britain and Australia, pop-ups are slowly seeping their way into the Indian food industry. These temporary restaurants make full use of the latest social media tools to inform customers of their services. Their brief period of existence ranging from just an evening to an entire month proves just how cost-effective and extremely experimental it can be. Apart from being a whole new restaurant, they can also be of other types; they can be ranging from special menus to existing restaurants transforming themselves for a short while. Pop-ups can be anywhere, parks, galleries, old stores, warehouses, etc.

Restaurateurs, as well as customers, are stepping outside their comfort zones and probing into the new trends of the pop-up culture in India. There has been an increased rise in this new fad and the numerous benefits that Pop-ups offer are only adding to this popularity. They are known for their deliciously good food, low investments and fast turnover rates which allow chef’s to explore their creativity to the fullest. There’s minimum money spent in case of direct and indirect costs as well as capital this, in turn, increases profit margins greatly.

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/the-rise-of-pop-up-restaurants-in-india/shutterstock_430149913/" rel="attachment wp-att-2636"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_430149913-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2636" align="left"style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 25px/></a>

They aren’t only cost effective for the restaurateurs but for the customers as well as they are usually priced at a reasonable amount. Variety is the biggest advantage that pop-ups have to offer its clients, the food available is unique, new and different which allows customers to go on a food adventure. Offering a flavourful blend of secret, great sustenance and exclusiveness for a couple of fortunate clients; it’s not hard to perceive any reason why such a large number of foodies are dependably watchful for the next pop-up.

It’s a tool for fundraising as well as finding out the receptivity of a completely new cuisine which in a sense is a great market research tool. The model allows a great deal of inventiveness and imagination on behalf of established chef’s as well as amateur home cooks. This results in the creation of quality fusion food which inevitably expands the industry as a whole. 

However, they are not always glamorous as there’s always a great deal of planning and logistics that goes on behind it. Transportation of supplies and equipment can be a major roadblock for the pop-up places. Simple things like supplying food and handling dinner rushes can be difficult due to the fast-paced nature of this industry. Some unusual menus may not receive as much traction as expected as people may be slightly closed minded.

Even so, there is no doubt that pop-ups are the future of the food industry. It’s never too late to take a break from the mundane and traverse into the areas that have never been touched upon, risk-free.

<b><i>Now you see me, now you don’t.</b></i>

Popularised in the 2000s in Britain and Australia, pop-ups are slowly seeping their way into the Indian food industry. These temporary restaurants make full use of the latest social media tools to inform customers of their services. Their brief period of existence ranging from just an evening to an entire month proves just how cost-effective and extremely experimental it can be. Apart from being a whole new restaurant, they can also be of other types; they can be ranging from special menus to existing restaurants transforming themselves for a short while. Pop-ups can be anywhere, parks, galleries, old stores, warehouses, etc.

Restaurateurs, as well as customers, are stepping outside their comfort zones and probing into the new trends of the pop-up culture in India. There has been an increased rise in this new fad and the numerous benefits that Pop-ups offer are only adding to this popularity. They are known for their deliciously good food, low investments and fast turnover rates which allow chef’s to explore their creativity to the fullest. There’s minimum money spent in case of direct and indirect costs as well as capital this, in turn, increases profit margins greatly.

<a href="http://35.154.220.37/the-rise-of-pop-up-restaurants-in-india/shutterstock_430149913/" rel="attachment wp-att-2636"><img src="http://35.154.220.37/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_430149913-400x267.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2636" align="left"style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 25px/></a>

They aren’t only cost effective for the restaurateurs but for the customers as well as they are usually priced at a reasonable amount. Variety is the biggest advantage that pop-ups have to offer its clients, the food available is unique, new and different which allows customers to go on a food adventure. Offering a flavourful blend of secret, great sustenance and exclusiveness for a couple of fortunate clients; it’s not hard to perceive any reason why such a large number of foodies are dependably watchful for the next pop-up.

It’s a tool for fundraising as well as finding out the receptivity of a completely new cuisine which in a sense is a great market research tool. The model allows a great deal of inventiveness and imagination on behalf of established chef’s as well as amateur home cooks. This results in the creation of quality fusion food which inevitably expands the industry as a whole. 

However, they are not always glamorous as there’s always a great deal of planning and logistics that goes on behind it. Transportation of supplies and equipment can be a major roadblock for the pop-up places. Simple things like supplying food and handling dinner rushes can be difficult due to the fast-paced nature of this industry. Some unusual menus may not receive as much traction as expected as people may be slightly closed minded.

Even so, there is no doubt that pop-ups are the future of the food industry. It’s never too late to take a break from the mundane and traverse into the areas that have never been touched upon, risk-free.

Food Service (India) Pvt. Ltd., a VKL Food Solutions enterprise, participated in the coveted 32<sup>nd</sup> AAHAR – The International Food &amp; Hospitality Fair at Pragati Maidan, Delhi for the fourth time in a row. Organized by India Trade promotion Organization, the exhibition witnessed around 50,000 attendees and 1,040 exhibitors including 78 foreign companies. Food Service India’s exhibition stall was themed ‘Food Festival for Culinary Experts’ and the visitors were served a five-course meal made using a wide range of Food and Beverage Solutions that our company has to offer.

Based on the theme of the event, the exhibition area had various stall spaces for our brands Sunbay, Spicefield, Springburst, Chef’s Art, VSPL and Keya; each of which had a live demo that portrayed the application of our products to the visitors. For example, Sunbay boasted a ‘Fine Dine Kitchen’, which was a live cooking and sampling session. There was also a live sampling food truck dedicated to our brands Springburst and Chef’s Art that was a prime focus of attraction for all our visitors. We also had a photo corner to help engage our visitors with the brand.

Food Service (India) Pvt. Ltd. launched seven new products at AAHAR 2017. The range included International Seasonings, Sauces and Premium marinade.

As a complete Food and Beverage Solutions provider, it was our pleasure to be the exclusive spice, seasoning, and syrup partner for the event ‘Culinary Art India 2017’. The Culinary and Mixology competition was a great platform where around 70 budding Chefs and Mixologists used our Spicefield Spices, Chef’s Art Seasonings, and Marimbula syrups in their competitive recipes to win the top position.

Food Service (India) Pvt. Ltd. won the silver medal for the excellent display and visitor management for the 2nd time in a row amongst 460 exhibitors in the Food and Processed Food category.

AAHAR 2017 was a great success for Food Service (India) Pvt. Ltd. giving it an opportunity to convey its value proposition, display its wide product portfolio to the target segment, and have effective meetings with prospective clients. We hope to participate in the event in coming years with a greater success.

<div class="ImagesText">Out of all the bountiful spices available to us, vanilla has stayed true to its title of the 'Little Pod'. Derived from the Spanish word vaina, this little pod not only makes for a great spice, but fashions great cocktail. The Marimbula Vanilla and white chocolate syrups are made up of some of the most preferred flavours of all time, making this creamy cocktail a delicious mix.
If you've ever sipped on chilled vanilla shake on a cold Christmas night, with a side of white chocolate, adding a little bit of Vodka gives your taste buds a pleasant surprise.Adding on to the holiday delight, we added fresh cream to this drink to make your Christmas whiter and brighter.
To top it off with some delicious snow, we added white Chocolate snow flakes, and poured it in a fancy martini glass. In short, this drink is comprised of ice, spice and everything nice.<strong>Vanilla Chocolate Alexander Recipe</strong>
